# WebView-Performance
A simple project that tests the performance capabilities of JavaFX's WebView 

Working with a moderately-sized JavaFX application that uses some performance-intensive javascript find attached a functionally equivalent sample.

In this project you'll find a javascrip t file htat does the "run"partt of the app as ell as take some timing.

On the java side, theeres'a webview that loads the web page and eceives log messages (for timing) and an exit signal.

The runtests.bat file goes and changes the path, compiles and runs the test app wth each update from u40 to u92

Tests have been performed in windows, which is where the difference is more evident.
